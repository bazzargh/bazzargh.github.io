  <h1>Stripmaps</h1>
  <p><em>This is a bit of a rambling work in progress but TL;DR it shows how to automatically draw maps like the one on the left for any route!</em></p>
  <p>Stripmaps are slices of map that represent a journey from one place to another,
without necessarily being too hung up on the accuracy of the projection when you
stray off the path. A good example is Taylor and Skinner's <a href="http://maps.nls.uk/atlas/taylor-skinner/index.html">Survey and Maps of the Roads
  of Northern Britain or Scotland', 1776</a> - the first road atlas of Scotland.
</p>

  <p>They have a convenience for following routes that 'proper' maps don't; as in the road atlas
(and later similar AA books) you could flip through your journey a slice at a time, or
if printed end-to-end, you could simply scroll from one end to the other, as with
the Inspector Gadget-esque <a href="http://99percentinvisible.org/article/analog-gps-scrolling-wrist-car-mounted-maps-roaring-20s-30s/">Wristlet</a>
from the 1920s. Similar devices still exist for motorcycle roadbooks.</p>

  <p>Nowadays we are awash with map data, and routes recorded from our runs and rides.
  A <a href="https://somethingaboutmaps.wordpress.com/2015/09/28/a-matter-of-perspective/">linear map by Daniel Huffman
of Lake Michigan</a> showed one way modern map data can be used to construct the maps, 
but this was a labour of love, with carefully hand-picked transformations. Shouldn't
it be possible to build such stripmaps automatically?</p>

<h2>Modified Zhao-Saalfeld</h2>

<p>A first step to maps like Huffman's, which distorts the map freely, is to try to build
a stripmap from a route using equal-width rectangular strips, as you might with scissors and glue.
In essence, such stripmaps take a polyline (a complex path of straight segments) and construct
a simpler path (the centreline of the rectangles) which lies within some tolerance of the original line.
Polyline simplification algorithms like Douglas-Puecker are widely used in mapping applications, we just need one that
provides the required guarantees.</p>

<p>The Zhao-Saalfeld algorithm (<a href="http://www.mapcontext.com/autocarto/proceedings/auto-carto-13/pdf/linear-time-sleeve-fitting-polyline-simplification-algorithms.pdf">LINEAR-TIME SLEEVE-FITTING POLYLINE SIMPLIFICATION ALGORITHMS</a> - Zhiyuan Zhao, Alan Saalfeld)
isn't so widely known as Douglas-Peucker, but fits the bill - it's a greedy algorithm that uses
a sector bound (a minimum and maximum angle) to decide the angle of the next strip and when
points no longer fit inside a strip from an origin point. However there are a few errors in the paper,
in particular if the line doubles back inside the strip, some of their algorithm variants will drop
the furthest points from the origin. By splitting the strip at the furthest point from the origin
that lies within the sector bound - even if that is not the furthest point that could lie within the strip - we maintain the required guarantee.
<b>The variant used to draw the map on the left in your browser entirely automatically from 7970 waypoints, is shown below.</b></p>

<pre style="padding: 1em; background-color: #f8f9fa; border: 1px solid #eaecf0; ">
function stripmap(w, points) {
  var start = 0;
  var strips = [];
  while (start < points.length - 2) {
    var furthest, furthest_r = -1, lo, hi;
    for (var i = start + 1; i &gt; points.length; i++) {
      var [r, theta] = polar_coords(points[start], points[i]);
      var angle = Math.asin(Math.min(1, w/r));
      var [lo_i, hi_i] = closed_open_sector(theta - angle, theta + angle);
      if (i == start + 1) {
        [lo, hi] = [lo_i, hi_i];
      } else {
        [lo, hi] = intersection(lo, hi, lo_i, hi_i);
        if (hi &gt;= lo) {
          break;
        }
      } 
      // the split criteria in the next 5 lines differ from ZS
      theta = normalize_angle(theta, lo);
      if (theta &gt; hi &amp;&amp; furthest_r &gt; r) {
        furthest = i;
        furthest_r = r;
      }
    }
    strips.push(points.slice(start, furthest + 1));
    start = furthest;
  }
  return strips;
}
</pre>

<p>After constructing the strips, there's a bunch of tedious maths to orient
them vertically and fill them with tiles (it's just a flood fill, using the separating
axis theorem to decide when a map tile intersects the strip). Rendering is pretty quick.
The rest of the code is <a href="https://github.com/bazzargh/bazzargh.github.io/tree/master/stripmap">here</a></p>

<p>Firstly: <b>it works!</b> There are abrupt changes in direction, but the
compass roses help - just as they did in Taylor and Skinner's original maps.
The strips are presented as a continuous vertical map for easy scrolling. It'd be a trivial change
to adapt this to preferentially split at points of interest, eg route descriptions
at waypoints; that was my original motivation for doing this - I wanted to
describe my own cycles through France alongside their routes.</p>

<h2>Other Possible Algorithms (that I won't use)</h2>
<p>Rather than abrupt changes, is it possible to distort the route so that
we straighten it <i>somewhat</i> - say finding the minimum changes of curvature
required to straighten the map? Distorting the map further introduces a complication.
One attractive feature of the Modified ZS algorithm above is that I can just use pre-rendered map tiles,
since the resulting transformations are just translations and rotations.
A straightening of the map is of necessity not an affine transform (ie 
parallel lines will not be parallel in the result). We <i>can</i> transform
raster map tiles this way in HTML, using projective transforms (introducing
perspective) but the result would also distort map labels illegibly and we should
consider vector transforms of the map instead - ie transform points in the
underlying map data then re-render.</p>

<p>Some of the things I looked at to attempt this were:</p>
<ul>
  <li>finding the minimum curvature path that stays within the desired bounds
  (see eg <a href="http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0045794908000163">Race Driver Model, F. Braghin, F. Cheli, S. Melzi, E. Sabbioni</a>).
  It's nice to know there's a closed form, but this doesn't help, because I need to construct that racetrack in the first place and it may not always be
  possible.</li>
  <li>smooth deformations along a spine (instead of slicing into relatively large strips); see the work on <a href="http://www.transmogrifiers.org/description/">Transmogrifiers</a> of Brosz et al.
  In this case I could just use the route itself as the spine, but I got bogged down thinking about overlapping off-spine regions in tight curves, and aesthetically, we do not want the stripmap
  to be entirely straight along the route; which means I need the spine to wander around the route. The transformation itself looks great, but I can't get to a decent starting point.
  </li>
</ul>

<h2>A* Train-Track - work in progress</h2>

<p>However - if we are using non-affine transforms anyway, there may be simpler
ones to work with. Imagine building a toy train-track along our route, with
prefabricated straights and curves. That changes the problem from one of looking
at a continuous minimum-curvature shape to discrete points with potential connections;
suggesting a graph search algorithm like A* can be used to discover the optimal
'train track' to cover our route.</p>

<p>Train tracks consist of clothoid curves, but since we are trying to keep the
maths simple, we can just consider circular arcs of differing radii of curvature. When we
come to transform our vector data, circular arcs keeps the equations simple.</p>

<p>I mentioned prefabricated train track segments, but in trying to keep the
route points covered by the track, it is easier to think of segments that
start at some variable angle, then at each point on the route we maintain
an <i>inverse radius of curvature bound</i>, like the sector bound of Zhao and Saalfeld. (I'm going
to need to insert pics here as this is awkward to describe). When the IRC is negative, the
track curves left, when it is positive, the track curves right, when it is zero we have straight
segments. We assign score penalties to excessive track curvature, and greater penalties when the
track must abruptly change direction; A* will then seek our ideal track. Pseudocode:</p>

<pre style="padding: 1em; background-color: #f8f9fa; border: 1px solid #eaecf0; ">
def curvature(p0, a, p)
  # transform origin to right edge
  p'.x = p.x - p0.x
  p'.y = p.y - p0.y
  # rotate away angle
  p''.x = p'.x * cos a - p'.y * sin a
  p''.y = p'.x * sin a + p'.y * cos a
  [arcwidth, theta] = polar(p0, 0)
  if theta < -pi/4 || pi/4 < theta
    return Nothing
  end
  # (arcwidth/2)/r = cos(pi/2 - theta)
  Just (2 * cos(pi/2 - theta))/arcwidth
end

def split_point(P, w, a)
  right.x = p0.x + w * cos a
  right.y = p0.y + w * sin a
  left.x = p0.x - w * cos a
  left.y = p0.y - w * sin a
  for p in P
    if undefined(p0)
      p0 = p
    else
      # transform origin to right edge
      point_curvature = curvature(p0, a, p)
      # next line is a sketch, need to add/subtract w from the curvatures
      if max_left <= point_curvature && point_curvature <= min_right && r > distance(p0, best)
        best = p
      end
      right_curvature = curvature(right, a, p)
      left_curvature = curvature(left, a, p)
      if right == Nothing || left == Nothing
        return best
      end
      min_right = min(min_right, fromJust right_curvature)
      max_left = max(max_left, fromJust left_curvature)
    end
  end
end
